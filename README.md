# Sentiment-Analysis-Dense-Neural-Network-vs.-LSTM
This research compares dense neural network and LSTM networkâ€™s performance on binary classification of text data in three criteria: (1) prediction accuracy; (2) loss value; (3) run time. The results show that, after finetuning, the final DNN model achieved predictive accuracy on test set similar to the final LSTM model but with much less train time. Both models suffered performance bottleneck. Our research show that RNN models do not always outperform other ML algorithms in language processing tasks. When the sequences of inputs do not matter, like sentiment analysis where the machine learn the frequency of the words, RNNs do not offer better performance but are more expensive to train.
